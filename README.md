# Product Sales Simulation

This project aimed to create a real-life (almost) analysis of how a product would sell in an Indian market comprising various types of population. This was a helper project in my course Innovation & Entrepreneurship during semester 6 (Q1-2 2018).
This python based project used Matplot Lib to plot the results obtained as day-wise & sales-wise graphs. Other than that it exports the data in a usable CSV format.
