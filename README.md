# Product Sales Simulation

This project aimed to create a real-life (almost) analysis of how a product would sell in an Indian market comprising various types of population. This was a helper project in my course *Innovation & Entrepreneurship* during semester 6 (Q1-2 2018).
This python based project used Matplot Lib to plot the results obtained as day-wise & sales-wise graphs. Other than that it exports the data in a usable CSV format.

## Business Model Canvas

The above mentioned BMC was implemented in the sales simulation software. All the constraints are considered with respect to the BMC and implementation of this BMC in Indian Market.

## Output Plot
***Matplot Lib is used for the plots. Install Matplot Library before compiling the index.py file.***

The output obtained contains two plot, first one with product-sales wise analysis and second one with day-wise analysis versus the total profit. Total profit is calculated by subtracting Total money gained on product sales and Total initial investment. The Yellow line axis gives us **no-profit-no-loss** or **break-away point**. The red dots on the day-wise analysis curve gives us the info of years passed.
